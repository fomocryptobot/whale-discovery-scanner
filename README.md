    wallet_address VARCHAR(128) PRIMARY KEY,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **üìà Key Database Operations**

```python
# Advanced schema validation before processing
cur.execute("""
    SELECT column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length 
    FROM information_schema.columns 
    WHERE table_name = 'whale_transactions' 
    ORDER BY column_name;
""")
schema_info = cur.fetchall()

# Atomic discovery transaction with conflict handling
query = """
    INSERT INTO whale_transactions (...)
    VALUES (...)
    ON CONFLICT (transaction_id) DO NOTHING;
"""
```

**2. Foundational Whale Wallet Registry Management**:
```python
# Ensures discovered whale wallet exists before transaction insert
wallet_query = """
    INSERT INTO wallet_accounts (wallet_address) 
    VALUES (%(wallet_address)s) 
    ON CONFLICT (wallet_address) DO NOTHING;
"""
```

**3. Foundational Data Validation Pipeline**:

## ‚öôÔ∏è **CONFIGURATION & DEPLOYMENT**

### **üîê Environment Variables**

**Required Production Variables for Foundational Discovery**:

| Variable | Purpose | Security Level | Foundational Requirements |
|----------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|
| `TRINITY_DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection | **Critical** | High-availability for foundational data |
| `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` | Blockchain blue-chip access | **High** | Pro tier recommended for blue-chip volumes |
| `COINGECKO_API_KEY` | Blue-chip pricing | **Medium** | Pro tier for reliable institutional pricing |
| `CACHE_BUST_FINAL` | Deployment versioning | **Low** | Cache management for reliable deployments |

**Foundational API Implementation Best Practices**:

```python
# Secure environment variable loading with foundational-specific validation
DB_URL = os.getenv('TRINITY_DATABASE_URL')
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = os.getenv('ETHERSCAN_API_KEY')
COINGECKO_API_KEY = os.getenv('COINGECKO_API_KEY')

# Foundational-level validation with informative error messages
if not DB_URL:
    raise ValueError("‚ùå TRINITY_DATABASE_URL required for foundational whale discovery data")
```

### **üöÄ Render.com Foundational Deployment Configuration**

**Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
**Start Command**: `python whale_discovery_scanner.py`
**Cron Schedule**: `30 17,23,5,11 * * *` (4 times daily at global trading session overlaps)

**Foundational Performance Settings**:
- **Memory**: 1GB recommended (foundational processing requires substantial memory for schema validation)
- **CPU**: Shared CPU sufficient (processes ~200-800 foundational transactions per scan)
- **Storage**: Ephemeral (stateless design, all foundational data persisted in PostgreSQL)

**Production Environment Variables** (Render.com):
```bash
CACHE_BUST_FINAL=v6-rebuild-2025-07-25-0125
COINGECKO_API_KEY=CG-bJPibgyMemFNGv5dp4nvA9xm
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=GCB4J1IT34YG29GNJJX7R7JADRTAFJKPDE

python test.py
# Expected output: "üéâ ALL IMPORTS SUCCESSFUL!"
```

**Foundational Scanner Execution Test**:
```bash
# Run single foundational discovery scan
python whale_discovery_scanner.py
# Monitor logs for successful foundational discovery analysis and schema validation
```

**Foundational Database Integration Test**:
```python
# Verify foundational database connectivity and schema validation
from whale_discovery_scanner import WhaleScanner
scanner = WhaleScanner()
success = scanner.connect_database()
print(f"Foundational database connection: {'‚úÖ Success' if success else '‚ùå Failed'}")

# Test schema validation
if success:
    cur = scanner.db_connection.cursor()
    cur.execute("""
        SELECT column_name, data_type 
        FROM information_schema.columns 
        WHERE table_name = 'whale_transactions';
    """)
    print(f"Schema validation: {len(cur.fetchall())} columns found")
```

### **üêõ Foundational Common Issues & Troubleshooting**

**1. Foundational API Rate Limiting**:
```
Error: "Max rate limit reached during foundational scan"
Solution: Increase foundational-specific delay constants
- ETHERSCAN_DELAY = 2.0  (increase for blue-chip data volumes)
- COINGECKO_DELAY = 0.3  (increase for institutional pricing)
```

**2. Foundational Database Schema Issues**:
```
Error: "Column length exceeded" or "Data type mismatch"
Solution: Verify schema matches production requirements
- Check field length limits before insert
- Validate data types match schema expectations
- Use schema validation function before processing
```

**3. Foundational Memory Issues**:
```
Error: Out of memory during foundational processing
Solution: Implement foundational batch processing
- Process blue-chip tokens in smaller groups (2-3 at a time)
- Clear foundational transaction arrays between token batches
- Optimize schema validation frequency
```

**4. Foundational Cache Issues**:
```
Error: "Cache bust failed" or "Deployment inconsistencies"
Solution: Update cache bust configuration
- Increment CACHE_BUST_FINAL version
- Verify environment variables match production
- Test deployment with fresh cache
```

### **üîß Foundational Enhancement Guidelines**

**Adding New Blue-Chip Tokens**:
```python
# Add to TOP_TOKENS dictionary (maintain institutional quality focus)
'NEWBLUE': {
    'address': '0x...blue_chip_contract_address...',
    'decimals': 18,
    'coingecko_id': 'new-blue-chip-token-id'
}
```

**Adjusting Foundational Whale Thresholds**:
```python
# Modify foundational threshold constants
WHALE_THRESHOLD_USD = 1500  # Increase for higher-value foundational moves
MAX_USD_AMOUNT = 200_000_000  # Adjust maximum foundational tracking limit
```

**Foundational Performance Optimization Areas**:
- **Schema Validation Optimization**: Cache schema validation results between scans
- **Foundational Caching**: Add Redis layer for blue-chip price data caching
- **Foundational Database Optimization**: Implement connection pooling for foundational data
- **Foundational API Efficiency**: Batch multiple blue-chip transfers in single requests
